<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>It's me. What can I say? Nothing really, I'm just one of those people who has a few skills but still doesn't know what to do with their life....</p>

<p>Master of none, I guess. I'm studying programming because I'm sick of working in my current industry. I feel there's no care anymore and everything is always about money.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, that's just business but I've had enough of watching people get ripped off and other people playing the 'that's not my job' card. So I want to work creativly and away from people. We can dream eh?</p>
