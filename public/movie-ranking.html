<h2>My go-to movies when people ask for my favourites....</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Thing (1982)</h3>
<p>If I had to choose only one film to watch for the rest of my life, I would choose John Carpenter's remake of The Thing (Original title: The Thing From Another World).
It has a simple premise, a claustrophobic setting and the practical effects still hold up. Not to mention the cast are fantastic. Everyone should see this at least once.</p>
<h3>Aliens (1986)</h3>
<p>One of the best sci-fi films ever made, one of the best action films ever made and one of the best sequels ever made. Terrifying and fun with amazing effects, models, sets and costumes.</p>
<h3>Snatch (2000)</h3>
<p>A favourite of me and my family. Super funny with memorable characters and a quotable script. Guy Ritchie at his best.</p>
